# Web Development Experiments

This repository is a collection of **small web development experiments** created while I’m learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Rather than polished applications, these projects focus on exploration, practice, and understanding how the web works.

Each folder represents a different idea, concept, or test — some are complete, some are rough, and many exist purely to help me learn.

## Purpose

This repo exists to:

- Learn the fundamentals of **HTML structure**, **CSS styling**, and **JavaScript behavior**
- Experiment freely without the pressure of “production-ready” code
- Try ideas quickly and see what works (and what doesn’t)
- Build intuition through hands-on practice

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – page structure and content  
- **CSS** – layout, styling, and visual experimentation  
- **JavaScript** – basic interactivity and logic  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and iteration

Frameworks and libraries may appear occasionally as I explore them.

---

## Project Structure

- Each folder contains a self-contained experiment
- Most projects include:
  - `index.html`
  - `style.css`
  - `script.js` (or similar)
- Some experiments may be incomplete, broken, or purely conceptual

---

## Future Plans

As my skills improve, I may:

- Refactor older experiments
- Combine ideas into larger projects
- Add accessibility and performance improvements
- Explore frameworks like React more deeply
- Turn select experiments into polished demos
